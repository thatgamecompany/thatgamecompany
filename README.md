Creating emotional journeys through artful interactive experiences. Home of Journey, Flower, Flow, and Sky: Children of the Light.

We believe games can be more than just entertainment - they can be meaningful experiences that connect people and evoke genuine emotions. Since 2006, we've been pushing the boundaries of what games can make you feel.

Our mission is simple: create timeless interactive art that touches hearts across generations and cultures. 

Join our growing family of 160M+ players worldwide as we continue to design experiences that celebrate human connection, empathy, and the small moments of joy we share together. âœ¨

Let's reimagine what games can be.
